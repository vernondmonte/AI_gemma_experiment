Many of the most powerful tools of statistical inference that we now have at our disposal can be traced back to the types of early analysis that Galton and his contemporaries were engaged in.  The sheer number of different regression-related methodologies and variants that are available to researchers and practitioners today is mind-boggling, and there are still rich veins of ongoing research that are focused on defining and refining new forms of regression to tackle new problems.\", metadata={'chapter': 0})"
